    "# Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "task involves processing and analyzing simulated banking document data extracted with OCR. The dataset includes various complexities such as OCR-like errors, transactions with currency symbols, multiple transaction types, and aggregated data. The objective is to develop a Python script to perform the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  1 Data Cleaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Correct OCR-like errors in account numbers and descriptions.\n",
    "    - Normalize amount values to a consistent format, handling currency symbols and negative values for withdrawals.\n",
    "- 2 Data Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "         - Identify and separate individual transactions from aggregated data (subtotals/yearly totals).\n",
    "         - Reconcile transactions by ensuring the consistency of aggregated data with individual transactions.\n",
    "- 3 Anomaly Detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "       - Detect and flag any unusual transactions that could indicate errors or fraudulent activity based on criteria \n",
    "       such as  unusually high transaction amounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4 Reporting:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Generate a report summarizing the findings from the analysis, including any discrepancies in reconciliation and a list of       detected anomalies.\n",

    "Provide a README file detailing how to run the script, an overview of the approach to data cleaning, analysis, and anomaly detection, and how to interpret the output. -->"

    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we developed a process and analyze simulated banking document data extracted with OCR. We aimed to achieve the following deliverables:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accuracy and Efficiency of Data Cleaning and Normalization:\n",
    "- We successfully corrected OCR-like errors in account numbers and descriptions.\n",
    "- Amount values were normalized to a consistent format, handling currency symbols and negative values for withdrawals effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Effectiveness in Reconciling Transactions and Summarizing Data:\n",
    "- Individual transactions were separated from aggregated data, ensuring accuracy in transaction reconciliation.\n",
    "- The script accurately summarized data, reconciling transactions and aggregated data effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ability to Detect and Logically Flag Anomalies:\n",
    "- Unusual transactions, such as those with unusually high amounts, were detected and logically flagged as potential anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Clarity and Organization of Code and Documentation:\n",
    "- The code was organized and structured logically, enhancing readability and maintainability.\n",
    "- Documentation, including comments within the code and a README file, provided clear instructions on how to run the script and interpret the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, met the objectives of the project, demonstrating proficiency in data processing, analysis, and anomaly detection in banking document data."
